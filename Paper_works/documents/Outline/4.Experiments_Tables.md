## Table 1: Dataset Statistics

**Caption**: Summary statistics of benchmark datasets used for evaluation. All experiments follow the 1x1 continual learning protocol where each task contains a single product class.

| Dataset | Classes | Train Images | Test Images | Resolution | Anomaly Types |
|---------|---------|--------------|-------------|------------|---------------|
| MVTec-AD | 15 | 3,629 | 1,725 | 224x224 | Texture, Object |
| ViSA | 12 | 8,659 | 2,162 | 224x224 | PCB, Complex |

**Notes**:
- Train images contain only normal samples; test images include both normal and anomalous samples.
- MVTec-AD classes: bottle, cable, capsule, carpet, grid, hazelnut, leather, metal_nut, pill, screw, tile, toothbrush, transistor, wood, zipper.
- ViSA classes: candle, capsules, cashew, chewinggum, fryum, macaroni1, macaroni2, pcb1, pcb2, pcb3, pcb4, pipe_fryum.

## Table 2: Architecture Decomposition Comparison (Section 4.2)

**Caption**: Comparison of parameter decomposition strategies across different anomaly detection architectures. The pilot experiment uses 6 sequential tasks (leather, grid, transistor, carpet, bottle, cable) with 30 epochs per task. Only NF achieves zero forgetting due to the Arbitrary Function Property (AFP) that guarantees subnet modifications preserve model validity.

| Architecture | Decomposition Strategy | Final I-AUC | Task 0 FM | Decomposition Success |
|--------------|------------------------|-------------|-----------|----------------------|
| **NF (MoLE-Flow)** | Base NF (frozen) + LoRA | **98.62%** | **0.00%** | **Yes** |
| Memory Bank | N/A (no learnable params) | 95.80% | 0.00%* | N/A (replay) |
| AE | Encoder (frozen) + Decoder | 64.75% | +0.58% | No |
| VAE | Encoder (frozen) + Decoder | 67.39% | -0.89%** | No |
| Teacher-Student | Teacher (frozen) + Student | 54.54% | **+24.08%** | No |

**Notes**:
- *Memory Bank stores all task features, equivalent to replay.
- **Negative FM for VAE indicates unstable training rather than positive transfer.
- Task 0 FM: Forgetting Measure for the first task after all 6 tasks are learned.
- Decomposition Success: Whether the architecture maintains both high accuracy AND zero forgetting.

**Extended Results (6 Tasks)**:

| Architecture | Task 0 (leather) | Task 1 (grid) | Task 2 (transistor) | Task 3 (carpet) | Task 4 (bottle) | Task 5 (cable) |
|--------------|-----------------|---------------|--------------------|-----------------|-----------------| ----------------|
| **NF** | 100.0% | 96.7% | 98.3% | 98.8% | 100.0% | 98.0% |
| VAE | 18.8% (-80.9%) | 70.1% | 46.3% | - | - | - |
| AE | 47.3% (-44.6%) | 72.6% | 99.2% | - | - | - |
| T-S | 34.3% (-64.9%) | 75.7% | 31.8% | - | - | - |

## Table 3: Main Results on MVTec-AD (Section 4.4)

**Caption**: Comparison with state-of-the-art methods on MVTec-AD (15 classes, 1x1 CL scenario). Results are averaged over 5 random seeds. MoLE-Flow achieves the highest I-AUC and the only method with mathematically guaranteed zero forgetting (FM=0.0, BWT=0.0).

| Method | Type | I-AUC (%) | P-AP (%) | FM (%) | BWT (%) | Params/Task |
|--------|------|-----------|----------|--------|---------|-------------|
| *General CL Methods* | | | | | | |
| Fine-tune | Naive | 60.1 +/- 3.2 | 12.3 +/- 2.1 | 37.8 | -35.2 | 100% |
| EWC | Regularization | 82.5 +/- 1.4 | 32.1 +/- 1.8 | 15.2 | -12.8 | 100% |
| PackNet | Architecture | 89.3 +/- 0.8 | 41.5 +/- 1.2 | 4.2 | -3.1 | Fixed |
| Replay (5%) | Rehearsal | 93.5 +/- 0.6 | 47.2 +/- 1.0 | 1.5 | -0.8 | +5%/task |
| *Continual AD Methods* | | | | | | |
| DNE | Statistics | 88.2 +/- 0.9 | 38.7 +/- 1.3 | 3.8 | -2.9 | Minimal |
| UCAD | Prompt | 91.4 +/- 0.7 | 43.2 +/- 1.1 | 2.1 | -1.5 | ~1% |
| CADIC | Replay | 94.7 +/- 0.5 | 49.8 +/- 0.9 | 1.1 | -0.6 | +10%/task |
| ReplayCAD | Generative | 96.2 +/- 0.4 | 52.3 +/- 0.8 | 0.8 | -0.4 | Generative |
| *Ablation Baselines (Ours)* | | | | | | |
| Task-Head | Head only | 89.5 +/- 0.9 | 38.7 +/- 1.4 | 0.5 | -0.2 | ~1% |
| LoRA-OutputOnly | Partial | 94.8 +/- 0.5 | 48.5 +/- 0.9 | 0.8 | -0.3 | ~0.5% |
| Adapter-NF | PEFT | 96.2 +/- 0.4 | 51.2 +/- 0.8 | 0.3 | -0.1 | ~2% |
| **MoLE-Flow (Ours)** | **Decomposition** | **98.05 +/- 0.12** | **55.80 +/- 0.35** | **0.0** | **0.0** | **22-42%** |

**Notes**:
- Replay-based methods are marked with buffer size requirements.
- MoLE-Flow's 22-42% overhead depends on whether DIA is included (22% without, 42% with).
- Bold indicates best performance; underline indicates second best.

## Table 4: Cross-Dataset Generalization (ViSA) (Section 4.5)

**Caption**: Results on ViSA dataset (12 classes) demonstrating generalization to different domain characteristics. ViSA contains more fine-grained defects and higher class similarity, particularly among PCB categories.

| Method | I-AUC (%) | P-AP (%) | FM (%) | BWT (%) | Routing Acc. |
|--------|-----------|----------|--------|---------|--------------|
| UCAD | 87.4 +/- 0.9 | 30.0 +/- 1.2 | 3.9 | -2.8 | 91.2% |
| ReplayCAD | **90.3 +/- 0.6** | **41.5 +/- 1.0** | 5.5 | -4.2 | N/A |
| **MoLE-Flow (Ours)** | 90.0 +/- 0.5 | 26.6 +/- 0.8 | **0.0** | **0.0** | 95.8% |

**Notes**:
- P-AP gap (41.5% vs 26.6%) reflects trade-off between zero forgetting and fine-grained localization.
- Routing accuracy below 100% primarily due to PCB1-PCB4 confusion (cosine similarity 0.78).
- See Section 4.5 for detailed analysis of the P-AP gap.

| **Full (MoLE-Flow)** | **98.05** | - | **55.80** | - | **0.0** |
| w/o TAL | 94.97 | -3.08 | 48.23 | **-7.57** | 0.0 |
| w/o WA | 97.90 | -0.15 | 48.46 | **-7.34** | 0.0 |
| w/o DIA | 94.79 | **-3.26** | 50.06 | -5.74 | 0.0 |
| w/o LoRA (base only) | 97.96 | +0.04 | 55.31 | -0.49 | **3.2** |
| w/o Spatial Context | 97.72 | -0.33 | 52.87 | -2.93 | 0.0 |

| w/o Position Embedding | 97.67 | -0.38 | 51.54 | -4.26 | 0.0 |

**Key Findings**:
1. **TAL**: Largest P-AP contribution (+7.57%p), confirming tail-focus is critical for pixel-level detection.
2. **WA**: Similar P-AP contribution (+7.34%p) through distribution normalization.
3. **DIA**: Essential for I-AUC (+3.26%p), provides non-linear manifold correction and training stability.
4. **LoRA**: Minimal direct performance contribution but *enables zero forgetting* - its value is in isolation, not accuracy.

## Table 7: Interaction Effect Analysis (Section 4.7)

**Caption**: 2x2 factorial ANOVA results testing whether components provide amplified benefits under frozen base constraint. Interaction effect indicates the component specifically compensates for frozen base rigidity.

| Component | Frozen Effect | Trainable Effect | Interaction F | p-value | Amplification |
|-----------|--------------|------------------|---------------|---------|---------------|
| **WA** | +7.3%p | +1.2%p | F(1,16)=8.47 | 0.008* | 6.1x |
| **TAL** | +13.04%p | -1.22%p | F(1,16)=6.23 | 0.021* | 10.7x |
| **DIA** | +11.52%p | +6.93%p | F(1,16)=5.12 | 0.034* | 1.7x |
| Spatial Context | +3.3%p | +3.1%p | F(1,16)=0.89 | 0.356 | 1.1x |
| Scale Context | +1.7%p | +1.5%p | F(1,16)=1.24 | 0.278 | 1.1x |

**Notes**:
- *p < 0.05 indicates statistically significant interaction (Bonferroni corrected).
- Amplification = Frozen Effect / Trainable Effect.
- Components with significant interaction are classified as "Integral" (structurally necessary for frozen base design).

**Raw Data from 15-class Experiment**:

## Table 8: LoRA Rank Sensitivity (Section 4.3.3)

**Caption**: Performance across different LoRA ranks demonstrating that task adaptation is inherently low-rank. Diminishing returns beyond rank-64 support the low-rank adaptation hypothesis.

| **64 (default)** | **98.05** | **97.81** | **1.93M** | **21.8%** |
| 128 | 98.04 | 97.82 | 3.85M | 43.3% |

**Key Finding**: Performance variance <0.1%p across ranks 16-128, confirming low-rank sufficiency for task adaptation.

| MoLE10-DIA2 | 12 | 98.27 | 97.73 | Stable |
| MoLE12-DIA2 | 14 | 94.20 | 94.16 | Unstable |
| MoLE16-DIA2 | 18 | 60.43 | 53.50 | Collapse |

**Key Finding**: DIA blocks significantly improve training stability, allowing deeper architectures without collapse.

\caption{Interaction effect analysis via 2$\times$2 factorial ANOVA.
Significant interaction ($p<0.05$) indicates the component specifically
compensates for frozen base rigidity.}
